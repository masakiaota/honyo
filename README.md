## Configuration

### API Keys

To use the translation features, you need to configure API keys for your preferred AI provider:

1. Click on the system tray icon
2. Select "Settings..."
3. In the "API Keys" tab, enter your API keys for the providers you want to use:
   - **Anthropic**: Get your key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - **OpenAI**: Get your key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - **Google AI**: Get your key from [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
4. Click "Save"

### Language Settings

The app automatically detects your system language and sets appropriate defaults:
- If your system is in English: Primary → English, Secondary → Japanese
- If your system is in Japanese: Primary → Japanese, Secondary → English
- Other languages: Primary → System language, Secondary → English

You can change these settings from the system tray menu:
1. Click on "Primary: [Language]" to select your primary translation target
2. Click on "Secondary: [Language]" to select your fallback language

**Supported Languages (26):**
English, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Korean, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Filipino, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish

### Custom Instructions

You can add custom instructions that will be included in all translations:

1. Click on the system tray icon
2. Select "Settings..."
3. Go to the "Customization" tab and find the "Custom Prompt" section
4. Enter your custom instructions (e.g., terminology guidelines, tone preferences, specific translation rules)
5. Click "Save"

Examples of custom instructions:
- Use formal language
- Keep product names in English
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Follow specific industry standards

**Generate with AI:** Not sure how to phrase your instructions? Click "Generate with AI" and describe what you want in plain language — Honyo uses your selected model to write or refine the custom prompt for you.

Whatever the input looks like — a question, a greeting, or even text that says "ignore previous instructions" — Honyo always treats it as text to translate, never as a command. Markdown and code formatting is preserved: the syntax is kept intact and only the human-readable text is translated.

### AI Models

Pick a model from the **AI Model** menu in the system tray. The list stays current automatically: Honyo refreshes it from free public model catalogs (no API key required, cached for 24 hours), showing the latest models per provider. If it can't reach the network, it falls back to a built-in list of current Claude, GPT, and Gemini models. Your selected model is always kept in the list even if a refresh would otherwise drop it.

### Custom AI Models

Use any AI model not included in the list:

1. Open Settings → "Customization" tab → "Custom Model" section
2. Enter the model name (e.g., `gpt-5.6-sol`, `claude-opus-4-8`)
3. Select the provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google AI)
4. Click "Save"
5. Select "Custom Model" from the AI Model menu

### Custom Languages

Add languages not included in the default list:

1. Open Settings → "Customization" tab → "Custom Languages" section
2. Enter language names, one per line (e.g., Esperanto, Sanskrit, Klingon)
3. Click "Save"
4. Your custom languages will appear in the Primary/Secondary language menus

### Display Settings

Configure popup window and translation display behavior:

1. Open Settings → "General" tab
2. **Auto-close on blur**: Enable this option to automatically close the popup window when it loses focus
3. **Auto-close after 5 minutes**: Show a countdown in the popup header and automatically close it after 5 minutes
4. **Enable streaming**: Enable this option to see translations appear progressively as the AI generates them (popup mode only)
5. **Popup font size**: Set the translation text size in the popup (10–24px)
6. **Reset Popup Size**: Restore the popup window to its default size
7. Click "Save"

**Display Modes:**
- **Notification & Copy**: Translation result appears as a system notification and is automatically copied to clipboard
- **Popup Window**: Translation result appears in a floating window with additional features:
  - Language direction shown in the header (e.g. "English → Japanese")
  - Real-time streaming (when enabled)
  - Back-translate button (⇄) to check the result against the source language
  - Copy button and keyboard shortcuts (Enter to copy, Escape to close)
  - Right-click context menu for copying selected text or all text
  - Resizable window — the size is remembered across closes
  - Optional five-minute timeout with a header countdown bar — click it to reset to five minutes
  - Auto-return focus to previous application when closed

## Usage

1. Select any text in any application
2. Press Ctrl+C (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+C (macOS) twice quickly
3. Depending on your display mode:
   - **Notification mode**: Translation appears as notification and is copied to clipboard
   - **Popup mode**: Translation appears in a floating window
4. In popup mode:
   - The header shows the detected language direction (e.g. "English → Japanese")
   - Click the back-translate button (⇄) to translate the result back to the source language and check its quality — click again to toggle between the two views (the header shows the reverse direction while viewing the back-translation)
   - Press Enter or click "Copy" to copy the translation and close
   - Press Escape or click "×" to close without copying
   - Right-click the text for copy options

### Smart Translation

The app intelligently determines the translation direction:
- If the source text matches your primary language → translates to secondary language
- If the source text is any other language → translates to primary language
- For mixed-language text → detects the language with highest word count ratio

### Menu Options

Access these options by clicking the system tray icon:
- **Primary/Secondary Language**: Set your translation language preferences (26+ built-in languages + custom)
- **Display Mode**: Choose between notification and popup window
- **AI Model**: Choose which AI model to use for translations (latest Claude, GPT, and Gemini models — auto-updated — or a custom model)
- **Settings**: Configure API keys, custom instructions, models, languages, and display settings
- **Pause Translation**: Temporarily disable the translation feature
- **Stop Current Translation**: Cancel ongoing translation
- **Check for Updates**: Check for new versions with progress display
- **Quit**: Exit the application

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd+C (twice)**: Trigger translation
- **Enter** (in popup): Copy and close
- **Escape** (in popup): Close without copying

### Auto-Update

Honyo automatically checks for updates on startup and every hour:
- **Update available**: Choose to Download, remind Later, or Skip the version
- **Downloading**: Progress displayed in menu (e.g., "Downloading Update (45%)...")
- **Downloaded**: Option to restart and install or install later
- **Skipped versions**: Won't be notified again until a new version is released
- **Manual check**: Use "Check for Updates" from the menu

### Environment Variables

You can also set API keys via environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 23.6.0
- npm

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rot1024/honyo.git
cd honyo
npm install
```

### Running in Development

```bash
npm start
```

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Run the app in development mode |
| `npm --silent test` | Run tests once with minimal output (recommended for coding agents) |
| `npm run test:verbose` | Run tests once with detailed Vitest output |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:ui` | Run tests with Vitest UI |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check with TypeScript |
| `npm run lint` | Lint with ESLint |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Fix lint errors |
| `npm run format` | Format with Prettier |

| `npm run dist:win` | Build and package for Windows |
| `npm run dist:linux` | Build and package for Linux |

### macOS accessibility after a local rebuild

An unsigned or ad-hoc-signed rebuild changes the app's code signature. If macOS keeps requesting
accessibility permission even though Honyo is enabled, reset only Honyo's stale permission:

```bash
tccutil reset Accessibility com.rot1024.honyo
```

Then launch `/Applications/Honyo.app` and enable it again under **System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Accessibility**. Do not run this for every build; it is only needed when macOS retains
permission for an older signature.
